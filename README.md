## HomeSafe (Front End)
This interactive crime map of Seattle provides an overlay of google maps in react/redux that allows users to sort for types of crimes, add user generated danger flags, and vote on said flags. Sporting Facebook OAuth, HomeSafe is a technology for... well. Getting people home, safe.
